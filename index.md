## Zahra Ghodsi

I am a PhD candidate at New York University, advised by [Siddharth Garg](http://wp.nyu.edu/ensure_group/). My research interests include Security, Privacy, Machine Learning, and everything in between. My research is partially supported by a J.P. Morgan AI Research Fellowship. 

Previously, I received a M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from NYU, and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.
